## Description
A JavaFX program for inputting and exporting lost and found items.

## Features
- Add/Delete items to a table.
- Ability to undo deleting an item.
- Sort items that are inputted into the table.
- Filter table based on items' location.
- Exporting table contents into a CSV file.
- Current time and date shown at all times.
- A piechart to show the amount of items per location in the table.

## Installation
1. Extract the ZIP file and import it into an IDE like Eclipse.
2. Setup JavaFX libraries in the IDE.

## How to use
1. Compile and run Main.java to start the program. Make sure JavaFX libraries are used.
2. To insert an item, fill out the location, name, date found, status, and description, of the item. Adding an ID for it is optional.
   Do NOT add commas while filling the text fields as that interferes with exporting it into a CSV file.
3. Press the 'Add' button to add it to the table.

### Optional Steps:
- Deleting an Item: Click a row on the table when All locations is selected, then click the 'Delete' Button. 
- Undo-ing deletion: Click the 'Undo' button after an item was deleted.
- Sort Table By Metadata: Click a column header on the table to sort it for that.
- Exporting Tabel Contents: Click the'Export' button. This will be exported to a CSV file called 'Table.csv'.
